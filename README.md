# Libft
The libft project is a custom C library, providing a comprehensive set of standard C functions for tasks like string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list handling. It serves as a foundational toolkit for C programming, allowing for efficient and reliable code development.

### Key Concepts:
- Algorithms and data structures
- String handling functions (strlen, strcpy, strcat, etc.)
- Memory management functions (malloc, free, memset, etc.)
- Character manipulation functions (isalpha, isdigit, tolower, etc.)
- Additional utility functions for various common tasks (ft_split, str_trim, etc)
- Linked list operations for dynamic data structures
- Makefile construction
